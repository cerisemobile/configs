        "description": "Nari is one of the 4 main Toca Mix videos characters.

APPEARANCE

Nari wears a white torso with a turquoise pocket with a pastel peach zipper across and light pink sleeves, one rolled up which reveals a lighter pink and the other hanging past her hand. Her hair is a very dark brown, nearly black colour. It’s always seen loose and just a little further down than her shoulders, and her fringe covers one eye. There are also two small triangles at the top of her head.


Nari is not mean

PERSONALITY

Nari is often described as “quirky” because of her careless nature. Examples of this are her frequent visits to the park to spy on unlucky victims, her cloud-like pet Croquet who can cook delicious food, and grow so large he could eat a human, and her odd sayings. She also can be very creepy, like in one of the first episodes when she made a pleasure song where she sang about the monsters in the apocalypse and how "the end times rule!!!" She also enjoys spying on her friends, as seen in the episode where she and Rita spied on Zeke and Leon. She also laughs when she purposefully scares her friends for pleasure as it can be funny to her sometimes. She also deeply cares about her imaginary friend that can only be seen by her unless someone knocks their head hard enough to let them see croquet. She also can summon crumpets although she also enjoys hunting for them and one time saved a village of crumpets with Zeke's help. She has a secret treehouse In the park which is totally huge!!! Nari is also a great and quirky friend and adventurer and someone most people would like to have around and a personal favorite of me and many other Toca Life World and MIX fans."
