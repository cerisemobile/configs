        "description": "PlayKids-XD is an open-world social game
in which you can create an avatar, decorate
a home, interact with other players, and visit
their houses. Start a new game with PK-XD
and the first thing you'll do is create your
custom character. This game has a colorful,
almost otherworldly aesthetic, and has loads
of character creation options. Once you
create a character, you can start decorating
your house, which has three rooms and a
hallway. Many of the basic items for your
house are free, so you can create a great
home without spending much of the in-game
currency. That being said, as you play you
can earn money and buy furniture, clothes,
accessories and other unique items to create
a complete custom character and home,
which you can edit at any point during the
game. But there's more than just your home
in PK-XD, there's an entire online world to
explore. Visit other player's homes, chat with
them, stroll around the city, buy food, go to
parties, and much, much more. Much like
games such as Hotel Habbo, most of PK-XD
gameplay revolves around customization and
interaction with other players."

Well, the only reason to get gems are only
these options: -Buy them with real money. -
Get them for free by collecting fruits, and get
the mystery crate, and random prices appear.
-Logging in every day so in the fifth day you
log in, you get gems. -Going to the crazy run
in the Giant robot will give you gems if you
play 5 times. (You might get free furniture but
not gems) And collecting fruits in the Juice
Factory 3 times will give you a surprise box. -
Drink a power up to get to the top of the Juice
Factory."
