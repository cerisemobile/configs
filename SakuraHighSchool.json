        "title": "Sakura School Simulator Beginners",
        "description": "With five playable characters, both male and female available, this game is perfect for anyone. The mobile game is played in a little fictional Sakura town. A mixed world, this amazing game combines both of the situations in the real high school everyday life in Japan and the situations which are shown in Japanese animations that everyone knows sometimes include very fantastic elements.
        And the best part is the ability to control and change Four players in the same scene. Each action you make towards the other NPCs will affect your gameplay, leading you to different situations.
        There are five playable characters:
Rina Tamaki (girl)
Taiga Yuki (boy)
Yuta Aida (little boy)
Mio Aida (little girl)
Cat Butler Robot
Now, let’s step into the world of Sakura School. Starting off, unless you choose to become any of the other playable characters, you’ll start off as the teenage girl and spawn in front of her house. From there you can go to the school or look around, as there is much to see in this game.

Also remember that if you don’t kill the members, or even die, they will keep following and attacking. "

After befriending them, you can select the option give me some money located at the talk button. But make sure to keep the status of your relationship up or they will not give you money."
